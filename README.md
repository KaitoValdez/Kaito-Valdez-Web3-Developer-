## 🧩 Web3 Developer | Community Architect | Technical Moderator

I am a **Web3 Community Architect and Technical Moderator** dedicated to bridging the gap between complex blockchain protocols and community education.

My work focuses on building **secure, scalable, and informed decentralized spaces** by combining:
- Technical support
- Proactive security infrastructure
- Clear, developer-first communication

I specialize in **hardening community platforms against scams**, creating **developer-focused onboarding guides**, and facilitating **on-chain governance** through DAO frameworks such as **Snapshot** and **Tally**.

I strongly believe that **technical literacy and clear communication** are the foundations of any successful protocol, and I’m committed to helping users navigate the decentralized web **safely and effectively**.
